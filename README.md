###Technical Requirements

- The "look and feel" of this application is totally up to you, make the application your own. The following basic requirements are:

1) Users of your application should be presented with a text field; this text field is where they will enter a temperature in Celsius
2) After the user enters in the temperature they should be able to submit their temperature conversion request (either via a click or submit event)
3) Upon submitting their request, the user should see the following:
  a) The converted temperature in Fahrenheit should be displayed to the user
  b) The background image should change based on the displayed temperature


- Example: If the converted temperature is 10 F (degrees) the background image should represent something cold
- Make the application your own - choose your own background images
